0:1:33|0:1:50|Night falls, the bustling streets of Tokyo are illuminated by countless lights. Above the intersection, a tram passes by with a clang. At this moment, a woman in a tight leather jacket stops her motorcycle in front of a hotel.
0:1:50|0:1:55|The elevator bell rang and the door opened. At some point, she found herself holding a carefully wrapped rectangular gift box.
0:1:56|0:2:17|Next, [Li Shan] sneaked into a beautifully decorated large penthouse, placed the gift box in her hand on a crystal glass coffee table, and carefully untied the packaging rope on the gift box. A cream cake came into view, but upon closer inspection, the center of the cake seemed to hide a liquid capsule.
0:2:17|0:2:27|Once everything was settled, [Leather Jacket Woman] hung up the phone and hurried back to the hotel downstairs. As soon as she pushed open the door, a huge blaze erupted halfway up the towering hotel.
0:2:28|0:2:41|Before long, the surroundings were shrouded in billowing smoke. Strangely, the explosion's fiery light added a touch of beauty to the brilliant night, and [SWAN] left without looking back.
0:2:41|0:2:49|At the same time in Hong Kong, at the UFS International press conference, the host is passionately introducing the key staff, player [David Marshall].
0:2:51|0:2:57|The moment the voiceover began, the spotlight shone directly on a young man with a stubble and a small braid tied up.
0:3:2|0:3:21|And not far from him, an Asian man in a sharp suit with earphones in his ears was patrolling back and forth in the venue. At this moment, the host's voice was heard again. As the legendary figure who has dominated three weight classes in UFS, today's press conference is a party exclusively for the player [David Marshall].
0:3:21|0:3:31|At the same time, the audience present are all witnesses of history, and no one in the future can stop them. Then, the host asked if there were any questions from the reporters in the audience.
0:3:41|0:3:56|[David Marshall] immediately rushed off the stage and the Asian Men's Alliance raised the walkie-talkie. At this moment, behind the stage, a handsome guy dressed similarly to the Asian men was sound asleep, with the voice of the Asian men occasionally coming through his headphones.
0:4:0|0:4:18|The handsome [Li Shan] was finally awakened by the noise. As soon as he arrived in the hall, he saw [David Marshall] had already grabbed the female journalist's collar, with a slap about to land on her. Li Shan quickly rushed to the two of them, elbowed [David Marshall]'s arm away, and then threw him to the ground.
0:4:28|0:4:48|[Li Shan] wanted to show off in front of the female reporter, playing the hero to save the beauty. Little did he know, he got the situation wrong and ended up being hit on the back of his head by an Asian man. Then, the two of them awkwardly smiled at the group of reporters, occasionally glancing back at the unlucky [David Marshall]. After the commotion, they got into a car and drove onto the street.
0:5:0|0:5:23|[Li Shan] lay on the passenger seat, facing the Asian man. Due to his excitement, the Asian man pushed hard, causing the seat beneath him to slide straight back and the steering wheel to slip from his hands. [Li Shan] quickly controlled the direction with his foot.
0:5:39|0:5:51|Upon hearing Asen mention changing the location again, the Asian man Li Shan was initially puzzled, but after hearing a few more words from the other party, he suddenly smiled and said "wait a moment," then looked towards [Li Shan].
0:6:8|0:6:22|An Asian man looked excitedly at the wild mountains, then tightly gripped the steering wheel with both hands, stepping on the gas pedal to set off. But just as he accelerated, the car seemed to be wheezing like an old man with asthma, swaying back and forth as it sucked in air.
0:6:22|0:6:32|At this moment, upon closer inspection, Li Shan had already concealed the color of the vehicle itself, and with a light touch, the rearview mirror could easily fall off. The scene then shifts as Ayo and Ling Xin arrive at Lianchuan.
0:6:42|0:6:46|Outside the airport, an Asian man hands a business card to [Li Shan].
0:6:59|0:7:2|An Asian man shouted that he loves Korea, then he put his arm around [Li Shan] and quickly walked straight to the taxi stand outside the airport.
0:7:18|0:7:37|The two brothers quickly arrived at the lobby of a hotel, where they heard an Asian man talking on the phone, saying he had already arrived. Then, a middle-aged foreigner with gray hair stood up and gestured towards them. The Asian man was puzzled as to why the person who had commissioned them didn't come together. Suddenly, a text message came through on the phone of the foreigner, [Ayo].
0:7:40|0:7:52|The three of them stood outside the door, ringing the doorbell but no one answered. When Li Shan heard Ayo say this was the place, he couldn't resist and stepped forward to knock on the door. As the Asian man was about to kick the door, he caught sight of the waiter and stopped.
0:8:4|0:8:16|The waiter saw Li Shan, an Asian man, clutching his stomach and screaming in pain. He took out a room key card and opened the door. Seeing the door open, he shouted in Korean to hurry up and ran straight into the room.
0:8:16|0:8:27|Upon entering the room, [Li Shan] noticed an unopened birthday cake placed on the center of the dining table. Seeing that the recipient was [Ayo], he turned and asked if the cake was meant for him.
0:8:27|0:8:37|[Ayo] denied it, then looked down and saw that it was a call from the client, so he quickly answered. But the next second, he felt something was wrong because the other party actually asked him where he was right now.
0:8:59|0:9:7|Thinking of hanging up the phone, but the other party actually guessed that there was cake and red wine in room 2003, which scared [Ayo] into immediately looking at these two things.
0:9:8|0:9:13|Little did anyone know, [Li Shan] had already cut a piece of cake and was enjoying it heartily.
0:9:27|0:9:45|In the underground parking lot, [Li Shan] put his arm around the shoulder of the Asian man, asking in confusion. With no answer in sight, he opened the passenger door and slowly got in. Suddenly, the parking lot went pitch black. Just as the Asian man in the back seat turned on the car's dome light, [Li Shan] swiftly extinguished it.
0:9:57|0:10:2|As soon as the words fell, a beam of strong light shone over.
0:10:6|0:10:13|[Li Shan] looked through the gap and saw a long-haired man casually throwing a palm-sized disc in front of him.
0:10:14|0:10:32|The next moment, he was firmly attached to the front windshield. In less than two seconds, a laser emitted from the center of the disc cut a hole in the glass, followed by thick smoke filling the cramped car compartment. Soon, a group of black-clad individuals wearing gas masks took [Ayo] away.
0:10:38|0:10:58|An Asian man, also known as Ayo, leaped towards the ambulance that the black-clothed person had opened without waiting for [Li Shan] to stop him. Unfortunately, he aimed wrong and ended up crossing straight through the space between the two back doors of the ambulance. He wanted to get up and chase again, but after falling heavily to the ground, he found that he couldn't use his waist strength.
0:10:58|0:11:6|Li Shan quickly climbed up from beside the car door and ran towards Ayo. Suddenly, the entire hotel shook, and debris kept falling down along the wall.
0:11:29|0:11:47|Seeing the ambulance about to disappear around the corner, [Li Shan] hurriedly urged [Ayo]. Unfortunately, the traffic light turned on, and the man in black decisively pressed the button, activating the ambulance's emergency siren. It swiftly moved through the busy road without any hindrance, with the two brothers quickly following behind.
0:11:47|0:11:50|But in an instant, it caused chaos in the surrounding traffic.
0:12:2|0:12:13|But soon, the two of them rallied again and chased after the old van in the distance. The intersection quickly became congested, but the instigator's fate was unpredictable and gone.
0:12:13|0:12:25|Suddenly, a two-meter tall off-road vehicle rushed straight from the rear side, crashing into the sedan at the intersection, then stepping on the gas pedal to lift one side of the car and pressing down on the hood of the other sedan as it chased after the old warehouse car.
0:12:28|0:12:37|The woman in the driver's seat glanced at the passenger seat, looking at the two brothers' well-defined figures, and a faint smile played on her fiery lips.
0:12:44|0:12:53|The glamorous woman then stepped on the gas pedal and crashed straight into the back of Li Shan's car. Ayo's steering wheel slipped from his hands, sending him towards the inner lane he was trying to maintain.
0:13:35|0:13:49|The seductive woman gave a devilish smile, and the latter immediately picked up a tablet. The off-road vehicle instantly connected to the electronic sensing system. The next second, the seductive woman was seen stepping over to the driver's seat window, her right hand tightly gripping the luggage rack on the roof.
0:13:49|0:13:58|After Daitianke used the computer to speed up the car, he swung a silver ball with his left hand towards the ambulance's roof. The ball fell and firmly attached to the roof.
0:13:59|0:14:15|And then, a laser beam split the ball in two. In no time, the bottom of the small ball was cut off by the laser, revealing a long circular surface far away. Ling Xin took the opportunity to leap up, descending from the sky to block the inside of the ambulance, picking up an electric shock gun and aiming it at the black-clothed men inside for a cleverly set trap.
0:14:15|0:14:28|At the same time, [Li Shan], who was provoked, was driving the soon-to-be-scrapped car closely behind. Sitting in the passenger seat, [Ayo] pretended to be unconscious, holding a sword and squinting at [Li Shan], then quietly fastened the seatbelt.
0:14:29|0:14:47|In the ambulance, the seductive woman quickly dealt with the black-clothed man in the back seat, then rode up front, left foot straight on the driver's neck, right elbow fiercely gripping the co-driver's throat. At this moment, [Li Shan] stepped on the gas pedal, crashing into the back of the ambulance. [Ling Xin] was caught off guard for a moment, unable to dodge, and was thrown back into the rear seat.
0:14:47|0:14:52|[Ling Xin] quickly got up and rushed towards the driver, tightly gripping his neck from behind.
0:14:53|0:15:3|[Li Shan] then rammed into the ambulance again, hitting the rear of the vehicle. The already precarious front hood was instantly flipped over, and the vehicle behind couldn't dodge in time, resulting in a head-on collision.
0:15:9|0:15:28|The character who had been pretending to be unconscious, [Ayo], suddenly widened his eyes, then raised his hands high and firmly gripped the handle above the car window. At this moment, [Li Shan] stepped on the gas pedal, quickly moving forward parallel to the ambulance, and then violently collided with the ambulance's body to the left. [Ling Xin], who had already controlled the steering wheel, saw a bend ahead.
0:15:28|0:15:33|Suddenly stepping on the brake, the rubber tires left two tracks on the ground, then accelerated to avoid the collision with [Li Shan].
0:15:55|0:16:10|Ayo was about to get off the car when he looked up and saw [Ling Xin] striding towards him aggressively. Just as Ayo opened the car door and stepped out, [Ling Xin] raised her hand and fired a shot at him.
0:16:16|0:16:20|Seeing [Ling Xin] charging towards him, [Li Shan] quickly slipped out from the passenger seat.
0:16:24|0:16:33|As soon as the words fell, [Ling Xin] pulled out the stun gun again and rushed towards [Li Shan], but [Li Shan] stepped on the ground, supported himself on the car roof with both hands, and flipped in front of [Ling Xin].
0:16:33|0:16:44|In the blink of an eye, [Li Shan] also took out a collapsible baton from his waist and struck the glamorous woman directly in the face. After the glamorous woman dodged to the side, he then pressed the baton on her back.
0:16:45|0:17:1|With a flick of the hand, the seductive woman disarmed the machine gun, but was caught off guard by a scorpion tail strike aimed at the back of [Li Shan]'s head. Swiftly evading the attack, she then planted both feet on the car door, leapt into the air, and landed a kick to the top of [Li Shan]'s head. Just as she grabbed the machine gun, [Li Shan] swiftly bent down and snatched it back from her.
0:17:1|0:17:19|At this moment, the ambulance suddenly revved up and sped away. [Li Shan] hesitated for a moment, then dropped the gun and ran towards the ambulance. Just as he took a few steps, a violent explosion occurred on the ambulance, the shockwave instantly knocked [Li Shan] over, and he hit the car on the side of the road before falling heavily to the ground.
0:17:19|0:17:28|Late at night, by the quiet dock, [Li Shan] and Ayo had their hands tied behind their backs, awakened by a Central Union man splashing water on them. Not far away were the glamorous woman and Swan.
0:17:52|0:17:58|The news reported that a terrorist attack has just occurred at Incheon Hotel A, with surveillance footage capturing two suspects.
0:18:3|0:18:11|In the news, not only are [Li Shan] and Ayo listed as wanted criminals, but also the information of the enchanting woman and two others is prominently featured.
0:18:53|0:19:2|Hearing the instructions of the seductive woman, [Ayo] prevented Li Shan from approaching Big Brother and lifted him into the air, then threw him into the water.
0:20:32|0:20:34|Qiao Ge picked up the portrait and looked at it.
0:22:6|0:22:19|Afraid that Li Shan might say something detrimental to the cooperation, Ayo quickly raised his glass to propose a toast. And so, the five of them tasted fine wine on the luxurious yacht, engaging in conversations that were strangely harmonious.
0:22:19|0:22:28|The next morning, a private plane arrogantly flew towards Thailand, [Ayo] handed a cup of coffee to interrupt [Li Shan] who was staring at the sunrise.
0:22:30|0:22:37|[Ayo] was lying on the leather sofa chair, enjoying a big sip of juice. [Ling Xin] glanced at him, then spoke up.
0:22:47|0:22:49|[Ayo] awkwardly smiles.
0:22:55|0:22:58|[Swan] pushed [Ayo]'s funny face out for everyone to enjoy.
0:23:21|0:23:25|Katie changed into a flight suit and stood in front of [Li Shan].
0:23:33|0:23:49|Watching [Ayo] in a flight suit, facing the strong wind while perched on the edge of the cabin for mental preparation, Katie suddenly kicked him in the back, then leaped from ten thousand meters high. The other three quickly put on their red goggles, spread their arms, and leaped from the cabin.
0:23:50|0:24:13|The tall and long-legged [Li Shan] continuously adjusts his posture in the air, with his arms close together and hands clasped, heading straight towards [Li Shan]. In no time, he presses the button on Li Shan's backpack, and the parachute opens with a sound. The five of them, now out of their flying gear, arrive in front of a high-end shopping mall.
0:24:13|0:24:19|The brothers Li Shan and Ayo complained, while Katie walked to the mall in high heels of nearly ten centimeters.
0:24:43|0:24:51|Katie then took the two brothers to a high-end men's clothing store. The manager brought out two rows of suits and asked [Baby] to choose for the two of them.
0:25:7|0:25:20|Tian Ke looked at the 1.87-meter-tall, sharp-eyed and angular [Li Shan], lightly bumping Katie's shoulder with a mischievous smile on his face. At this moment, [Li Shan] changed into a bright pinstripe suit, adjusted the French bow tie around his neck, and walked towards the mirror.
0:25:24|0:25:27|Katie took a big step towards [Li Shan] and helped her adjust her bow tie.
0:25:38|0:25:51|The newly-suited Ayo raised his eyebrows and asked, then was pulled to sit in front of a mirror. He saw Swan dig out a layer of hair mud with two fingers, and then wiped it on Ayo's forehead hair.
0:26:21|0:26:39|Li Shan has finished styling Ayo's hair. Ayo looks up and sees himself in the mirror, his bangs, which were originally neatly in place, now sticking up like an octopus tentacle on his forehead. Ayo touches his now set hairstyle and suddenly smiles, showing his satisfaction.
0:26:39|0:26:54|Li Shan, wearing a three-piece suit, swaggered behind Katie and the other two. At that moment, [Li Shan] in a short leather jacket approached from the side and walked in the middle of the group. With a high nose bridge and sunglasses casually hanging on it, exuding a cold and arrogant southern aura.
0:27:6|0:27:19|In the RV, [SWAN] placed a small paper-sized transmitter behind Ling Xin's ear. At this moment, there was a strange noise coming from the computer, as it turned out that Ayo had placed the transmitter on the center of his forehead. Ayo playfully swayed his neck.
0:27:46|0:27:51|On the beachside open-air market, Li Shan held a coconut drink, following behind a man in a baseball cap.
0:27:57|0:27:59|The two then sat at a small table by the roadside.
0:28:6|0:28:20|But the man in the baseball cap just lowered his head, took a bite of the sausage in his hand, indicating that he was unaware. Right Brother saw this and had to give up, leaving the table full of snacks untouched, gesturing for the man in the baseball cap to enjoy slowly, then picking up his suit jacket and leaving.
0:28:30|0:28:36|In the small building with stilts not far from the market, Righo's voice is transmitted to [Li Shan] through a transmitter.
0:28:36|0:28:54|Glancing back once again, the man in the baseball cap quickly took out his phone and whispered something after Right Brother left. Right Brother, holding an ice cream cone, turned into a dark alley without paying any attention to the two burly men following behind. [Li Shan] sat at the end of the alley, leisurely peeling an apple with a knife.
0:29:1|0:29:19|Indignant, she raised her hand and made a direct swipe, the small knife instantly disappearing under the crotch of the long-haired strong man. At this moment, Right Brother stood in front of the long-haired strong man in unison, lifted the handle of the knife heavily, asking where Dou Mupai was, while [Baby] picked up the snacks that had accidentally fallen on the ground and walked towards the RV with a cup of juice in hand.
0:29:43|0:30:0|Katie took a few bites of the grilled skewers and then hurriedly walked down from the RV. Seeing [Li Shan] still not moving, she gestured for him to follow. The two quickly sneaked into [Du Mupa's girlfriend]'s house under the cover of darkness. Katie tiptoed into the living room, took out her portable button camera, and placed it in the eye of a teddy bear.
0:30:6|0:30:21|Upon hearing [Tianke]'s response, [Li Shan] had no choice but to give up and then turned to walk towards [Du Mupa's girlfriend]'s room. Standing by the bedside table, she leaned over and picked up her phone. At that moment, Katie Dove approached [Li Shan] and handed her a data reader.
0:30:56|0:31:10|Li Shan, who had just said he wasn't afraid, suddenly jumped and sat paralyzed on the table by the window. After successfully copying the data from the phone, Li Shan and Katie walked slowly down the steps side by side.
0:31:37|0:31:51|In front of the computer, Li Shan saw Katie being stunned by the delivery guy. Baby, who was still smug and content, suddenly stood up straight, took out a stun gun, and turned to rush out of the RV.
0:31:51|0:32:1|When Li Shan arrived, the sedan had already driven far away. Ayo had to change targets, using a gun to stun the other group of black-clothed men who were planning to escape by car, then seizing their car and rushing out of the alley.
0:32:44|0:33:0|Ryo picked up his phone, looked at the location of the two people, and exclaimed excitedly. Sitting in the corner, Katie, who tried to avoid physical contact with [Li Shan], blinked and said. [Li Shan] reached out behind him with one hand, but couldn't find the switch no matter how hard he tried.
0:33:9|0:33:27|Katie, who had also freed her hands, extended her single arm straight out and rushed towards the light, but always ended up touching Li Shan's waist and hips in the process. Li Shan then caught Katie around the waist and carried her to the side of the door. The carriage suddenly passed over a speed bump, causing the just opened trunk to tightly shut once again.
0:33:31|0:33:52|At this moment, [Li Shan] embraced Katie, his right arm gently supporting her waist, while his left hand reached for the button on the car door again. When Katie realized, she shyly leaned against [Li Shan]'s neck, and then pulled down the door that had just opened again. [Li Shan] lowered his head, looking at Katie who was close by, and asked.
0:34:2|0:34:23|Brother You slammed on the gas pedal and accelerated away. He was closely tailing the car in front, but when he heard Katie's words, he suddenly felt something was wrong and quickly hit the brakes. Before the car came to a stop, [Li Shan] Katie rolled off the trunk and then ran wildly on the main road.
0:34:31|0:34:48|Driving towards them in the RV, [Baby] pointed a finger behind [Li Shan]. Brother Six bent down and got out of the car with the open trunk. Meanwhile, [SWAN] ran towards everyone. They didn't dwell on the earlier misunderstanding and quickly followed [SWAN] back into the RV.
0:35:40|0:35:49|Everyone followed [Baby]'s hand and looked ahead. The sign of the West Puan Hotel came into view.
0:36:33|0:36:38|The camera zooms in, a bearded man stands by the door.
0:36:58|0:37:5|Seeing Li Shan leaving, Ayo urged Katie, then immediately got up and sat in Katie's place.
0:37:30|0:37:33|Ayo awkwardly got up and slowly walked down from the RV.
0:37:43|0:38:1|[Li Shan] and Katie walked out of the elevator one after the other. As they bickered, they passed by crystal chandeliers and finally arrived at the door of room 1210. Unexpectedly, at this moment, Dumupa suddenly opened the door. [Li Shan] quickly reacted, grabbed the back of Katie's head, and kissed her directly.
0:38:1|0:38:7|Ke Du Mupa still found something wrong, turned sideways and flashed back into the room, isolating the two who were about to steal the car outside the door.
0:38:8|0:38:26|Continuing, he picked up the submachine gun and fired at the gate. [Li Shan] took advantage of her reloading break, punched open the already dilapidated door. After helping Katie up, he raised the stun gun and shot at Du Mupa. [Li Shan] seized the opportunity while Du Mupa was dodging, got up and knocked her submachine gun out with an elbow.
0:38:27|0:38:36|Immediately, he twisted his shoulder and pulled him down to the ground. Unexpectedly, as Dumupa fell to the ground, he kicked [Li Shan] directly in the abdomen.
0:38:41|0:38:43|With another twist, Li Shan had already rushed to the front.
0:38:44|0:38:56|Li Shan jumped up from the ground, with his left foot on the bed for support, and his right foot kicking straight towards Tom's face. This flying kick sent Tom's spine crashing heavily onto the glass coffee table behind him.
0:38:56|0:39:9|Continuing, [Li Shan] bent down and grabbed her collar, intending to ask what was going on. But seeing Du Mu Pa looking anxiously towards the cake box on the corner of the room's desk, she stopped in her tracks and carefully opened it.
0:39:18|0:39:24|Du Mupaze was surprised why [Li Shan] knew the cake was a bomb, and listened to what [Li Shan] said.
0:39:35|0:39:43|As soon as the words fell, a strange sound came from the well in Du Mupa. [Li Shan] quickly pulled open her collar, revealing a necklace-shaped bomb counting down.
0:40:18|0:40:25|The countdown sound effects became more urgent, as Du Mupa pushed Katie's hands away and rushed towards the bathroom in the room.
0:40:26|0:40:34|With a loud bang, flames instantly engulfed the entire living room, and the intense shockwave directly knocked Swan and Katie to the ground.
0:40:36|0:40:55|[Li Shan] pulled over a chair and smashed the land window. Jian Katie was still not giving up, planning to continue questioning Dongnan Han in the bathroom. [Li Shan] pulled him over and then jumped off the twelfth floor.
0:40:57|0:41:11|In the RV, the three who were already shocked by the explosion anxiously looked towards the hotel building. They saw Li Shan adjusting his posture instantly as he leaped out of the window, facing upwards with half of Katie in his arms, and falling straight into the open-air swimming pool below.
0:41:12|0:41:29|At this moment, in front of the floor-to-ceiling window of another hotel facing the street, a slender figure extended his right arm, elegantly playing with the firelight in the air. As the dust settled, the next morning in the RV was so cold and silent, Li Shan looked at Li Shan and Catty and said.
0:41:41|0:41:44|[SWAN] awkwardly pursed his lips in an attempt to liven up the atmosphere.
0:41:51|0:41:56|In the RV, [Li Shan] and Katie sit opposite each other, arguing loudly.
0:42:6|0:42:12|Katie inexplicably shifted her gaze back to [Li Shan] and then took a deep breath.
0:42:20|0:42:29|Katie banged on the door, swaggered in, leaving four people standing in place. [Li Shan] tapped the ground with his heel and took the lead to move forward.
0:42:37|0:42:41|[Li Shan] stopped moving forward, looked down, and suddenly, a heavy truck rushed out from the side of the road.
0:42:59|0:43:16|[Li Shan] looked towards the end of the road, only to see Katie's RV being hit by a werewolf. Four strong men walked down from the truck, intending to take Katie away, but before they could do so, [Li Shan] rushed over. The leader raised his hand and shot a tranquilizer dart, which firmly pierced into [Li Shan]'s right arm.
0:43:16|0:43:24|Li Shan didn't have time to think much. He folded the palm-sized anesthesia needle with his left hand, reached into his waist with his right hand, and swung out the expandable baton straight towards the opponent's face.
0:43:25|0:43:40|Suddenly, a short figure bent down, wielding a telescopic stick, and ended the fight in three or four moves. Unfortunately, the tranquilizer dart took effect suddenly. The leader took advantage of Li Shan's daze, got up, and headbutted Li Shan's waist and abdomen heavily.
0:43:40|0:43:45|[Li Shan] instinctively struck the back of the opponent's head with his elbow, then collapsed softly on the ground.
0:43:48|0:44:2|In a state of unconsciousness, it seemed to hear the playful laughter of children passing through the alley. Then, the children's voices seemed to be getting closer and closer. Before long, the voices of the children coincidentally stopped in a small wooden hut.
0:44:2|0:44:7|On a low bed that barely reaches the knees, a boy is approaching the unconscious [Li Shan] with a string of grilled snacks in hand.
0:44:9|0:44:28|Seeing [Li Shan] suddenly wake up, the children scattered and ran outside. [Li Shan] propped himself up with one arm and looked around. At the head of the bed, the hollow humidifier was working slowly, and a warm light on the ceiling helped people sleep. Afterwards, [Li Shan] got up and walked outside along a bamboo path to the end.
0:44:28|0:44:33|In front of them, the tall trees were decorated with lights and the high canopy was full of people.
0:44:38|0:44:41|Ayo and Li Shan, the newlyweds, bow and thank the guests.
0:44:58|0:45:9|[Li Shan] and Ayo looked around, searching for Katie's figure. The next moment, Katie crossed the passing guests and stood smiling in front of the two. [Swan] was roasting a whole lamb on the other side.
0:45:18|0:45:22|Tianke gnawed on corn, looking at Li Shan and Katie in front of the cabin.
0:45:26|0:45:31|After a moment of silence, [Li Shan] leaned his arms against the railing of the wooden hut and spoke to the person beside him.
0:45:40|0:45:52|Katie turned her head and looked up at [Li Shan]. Upon hearing this, [Li Shan] slowly avoided Katie's gaze and turned his eyes to the crowd celebrating in front of him.
0:45:54|0:45:57|Katie smiled lightly and didn't press for more answers.
0:46:24|0:46:31|At some point, Li Shan, who was gazing ahead, found his eyes moistened, and Katie looked away with a sigh.
0:46:37|0:46:41|Speak up, Katie turned her head to look at [Li Shan] again, but smiled and pursed her lips.
0:46:54|0:47:14|In a playful moment, [Li Shan] regained his composure and smiled at Katie. Just as they were bantering, the sound of fireworks suddenly rang in their ears. They both turned their heads in unison to look ahead, where colorful flags and lanterns hanging from the branches adorned the central area of the crowded forest, creating a warm and harmonious atmosphere.
0:47:15|0:47:37|The sky lanterns, filled with the beautiful wishes of people of all ages, rise slowly towards the sky in the hazy moonlight. However, at this peaceful moment, a breaking news alert comes through on Tianke's phone, indicating Singapore's stance on the terrorist attack. The injured will be taken care of, and there will be future cooperation with Thailand and Interpol.
0:47:45|0:47:49|Ayo was staring at the news footage, muttering to himself.
0:48:0|0:48:5|Next to the spokesperson, a woman in a [Ling Xin] suit caught Ayo's attention.
0:48:20|0:48:23|Tianke pulled up the woman's information and showed it to everyone.
0:48:37|0:48:39|Tianke lightly taps the keyboard, and a message pops up.
0:48:56|0:49:6|Katie assigned tasks clearly, and everyone immediately left the cabin to start preparing. The next morning, the five of them boarded a comfortable and luxurious private plane.
0:49:42|0:50:4|[Baby] quickly used a napkin to wipe [Li Shan]'s pants. At this time, Right Brother crawled out of the rear cabin with the lesson from last time, and was the first to put on the landing suit. "I'm ready to jump." Along the beach, as shady as snow and as soft as clouds, facing the sea, bathing in the morning sun, stands the towering A Hotel.
0:50:4|0:50:10|And facing the cliff above A Hotel, another five-story villa also shines with a touch of sunlight.
0:50:11|0:50:30|At this moment, the elevator bell rings and the door opens in the villa. Katie walks into the luxurious hall first, then stands in front of the leather sofa. Next, [Baby] raises a hand across the sofa, and the curtains in front respond and fall, allowing sunlight to filter in through the tall French windows, gradually illuminating the spacious and desolate hall.
0:50:30|0:50:47|Walking at the back, [Li Shan] and Ayo stopped in their tracks when they saw the scene ahead. Tianke, feeling at home, took a sip from his water cup and then walked over to the marble platform.
0:50:47|0:50:59|Shouting towards [Li Shan] and [Ayo], he pressed a water bottle spray on the stage. Suddenly, an oval-shaped secret door opened with a bang, and the top display cabinet was filled with various lipsticks, hair gel, and other cosmetics.
0:51:4|0:51:13|[Li Shan] and [Ayo] couldn't help but come to the display case. [Ayo] couldn't resist walking up and picking up a cylindrical hair gel bottle.
0:51:49|0:51:51|[Li Shan] looked at the electrified baton.
0:52:41|0:52:58|One person on the left and one person on the right grabbed his trousers and pulled them down, then turned around and threw them into the small fountain.
0:53:13|0:53:30|[Li Shan], who thought it wouldn't explode, argued as he stood up and looked at the mess in front of him. In the moment of the explosion, [Ayo] who shielded Katie quickly got up and pulled the two of them. Then, the four of them smiled at each other and helplessly looked towards [Swan] hiding by the fountain.
0:53:32|0:53:50|Li Shan, with only his underwear on his lower body, launched an attack while covering his face and crying in pain. After a brief farce, the five of them split up and began to act. In the busy dock, a crane was slowly dropping a container onto a truck. Once everything was loaded, the truck followed a car and left the dock.
0:53:51|0:54:9|In a hidden corner, a camper van followed. On the other side, [Li Shan] arrived at the top floor of Hotel A, put on special sunglasses, and could see the figures below through the ground. [Baby] drilled with a hammer, drilling several small holes about 10 centimeters deep on the ground.
0:54:9|0:54:16|Li Shan then carefully took out a small tube that looked like mascara and extracted the core inside, putting it into the hole.
0:54:18|0:54:31|A man in a floral shirt bows as he opens the car door for Ayo. He watches as Ayo's car drives away, then slowly straightens up, bending his waist to 90 degrees.
0:54:43|0:54:49|In the warehouse, the aunties stood on either side of a long table, picking out the dragon fruits from the wooden racks.
0:54:58|0:55:11|The floral shirt carefully picked out the small bags hidden in the pile of dragon fruits and opened them one by one, putting the contents inside into the delicate aluminum box, only to be interrupted by the voice of [Li Shan].
0:55:27|0:55:47|Li Shan looked at the warehouse, which was suddenly empty, raised his hand and said confidently. The man in the floral shirt turned around and ran towards the back, arriving at a rolling shutter door. He turned back and gestured towards the three people. Inside was a small room about ten meters square, densely packed with about fifty thugs.
0:55:47|0:56:5|Ling Xin looked up and understood the signal from the floral shirt. The group put down their dragon fruits and brandished their small knives, shouting as they charged out of the cabin. Before long, the floral shirt led them to the trio. The floral shirt smiled and tilted its head.
0:56:7|0:56:22|Standing behind him, a bald thug picked up the knife and ran it over his own head. [Li Shan] and Ayo exchanged a smile, then lifted their feet and headed towards Huacui Mountain. Just before the fight started, Katie kicked down the stairs and stepped on the railing of the second floor.
0:56:32|0:56:45|The water pipes on the ceiling burst one after another, spraying water directly towards the people on the first floor.
0:57:5|0:57:15|The people who had already been soaked in water could only watch as the electric current passed through their legs from the ground, slowly extending to their whole bodies. Soon, [Li Shan] was tied back to the suite.
0:58:38|0:58:44|In a moment of contemplation, the doorbell suddenly rings, startling [Ayo] into pulling the trigger, causing the floral shirt to faint instantly.
0:58:50|0:59:3|[Tom], with heavy eyeliner, answers the doorbell on the monitor. Katie looks at the flower shirt already passed out in the fountain and mutters. The elevator door opens, and [Tom] in floral shorts steps into the room.
0:59:14|0:59:26|[Tom] curiously looked around at everything in the room, then stood in front of Katie and took out four small tubes that looked like mascara.
0:59:32|0:59:40|With a constant smile on his lips, [Tom] casually placed the small tube into the glass jar in front of him. Then, the elevator doors opened again.
0:59:42|0:59:51|[Li Shan] was lying on his back, lifted by four bodyguards and carried in. [Ayo] leaned in close to [Li Shan]'s chest.
1:0:25|1:0:35|[Tom] raised a finger-sized remote control and smiled at Katie. Seeing Katie leaning towards [Tom] eagerly, [Li Shan] quickly grabbed her arm.
1:0:56|1:1:3|Watching helplessly as Kan Di, with his drilling fist, [Tom] turned around and walked towards the floor-to-ceiling window, arms outstretched.
1:1:25|1:1:31|[Tom], who was originally very excited, immediately became low-spirited.
1:1:36|1:1:42|[Tom] turned around, passed the three people, and then walked into the elevator with a joyful stride.
1:1:50|1:2:6|With long hair tied up high behind her head and a slightly cold gaze, [Ayo] commanded the three people in front of her with an unquestionable tone, then led a group of bodyguards away. As agreed, an hour later, the three of them drove to the underground parking lot of Hotel A.
1:2:6|1:2:28|Before turning into the parking space, the three of them saw Ayo leading a group of bodyguards out of the hotel building, then standing in front of the car. [Li Shan] had to step on the brake and walked towards Ayo first. Ayo heard Katie's response, turned her head to signal the bodyguards to search the car.
1:2:28|1:2:43|Right Brother, who got off the car right after, widened his eyes in an instant, but being trapped by Tianke, he could only obey without making a move. Therefore, the two brothers could only watch helplessly as Katie left the underground parking lot. Before long, Mei Yi arrived at the house with Katie, the bodyguard, and others.
1:2:44|1:3:1|Katie looked up to see the entire corridor covered with dark-patterned carpets, with six bodyguards standing on either side of the corridor. At the end of the corridor, only a human-shaped small window was leaking out, and although the sunlight generously shone in, it unexpectedly revealed a cold and eerie appearance.
1:3:1|1:3:10|At the end, turn left. On a larger square wooden platform, [Tom] is watching the screen, playing a game with his back to the crowd.
1:3:11|1:3:16|Katie bypassed the bodyguards sliding everywhere and went straight to [Tom]'s back, asking.
1:3:40|1:4:1|[Tom] dropped the game controller, turned around and walked towards the wooden platform, then bounced towards the stairs. He then leaned his hands on the railing of the stairs, looking down at Katie. Outside the hotel on the street, [Li Shan] and Ayo heard this and coincidentally glanced at each other.
1:4:3|1:4:16|At this moment, the man in the floral shirt, also known as [Li Shan], was kicked in the knee pit by a bodyguard and fell heavily to his knees at [Tom]'s feet. Then, [Tom] gestured with his finger, and a bodyguard handed him a transparent pill bottle.
1:4:25|1:4:28|Li Shan, who had been breathing rapidly, suddenly stopped when he heard it.
1:4:38|1:4:40|[Tom] looked up, his mouth curved in a brilliant smile as he gazed towards the sea.
1:4:44|1:4:58|[Swan] was held back by the bodyguards and could only watch helplessly as [Tom] gently placed the poison into his own mouth. He wanted to struggle, but when he looked up, he saw [Ayo] pointing a gun at his own head.
1:5:8|1:5:28|Tom, whose emotions were instantly ignited, jumped onto the terrace with a medicine box in hand. He reached his hand holding the medicine box towards the edge of the terrace, glanced at Ling Xin kneeling on the ground, then with a slight movement of his fingers, the medicine box containing the antidote fell from the 15th floor.
1:5:34|1:5:49|Just as they ran a few steps, [Ayo] was hit on the head by something, and when he picked it up, it turned out to be a pillbox. Yan Sheng, who had taken poison, originally intended to take the elevator, but was turned and pushed towards the stairwell by the bodyguard.
1:6:10|1:6:13|Bang! [Tom] sat on the genuine leather sofa on the terrace.
1:6:27|1:6:31|At this moment, [Li Shan] rushes into the hotel lobby and runs straight towards the elevator on the first floor.
1:6:39|1:6:59|When the elevator doors opened, Yan Shen screamed and rushed out from the nearby stairwell, coming face to face with [Li Shan]. Immediately, [Li Shan] abandoned the elevator, opened the door to the stairwell, and ran upstairs. Meanwhile, Katie decisively approached [Tom] and shoved the poison into his mouth.
1:6:59|1:7:4|At the sight of this, he raised his hand and threw the keys to Katie.
1:7:9|1:7:23|As soon as the words fell, [Li Shan] kicked two bodyguards and rushed in. He then raised the medicine box to signal to everyone. On the other side, Yan Shen had already run to the outside of the hotel door.
1:7:26|1:7:37|Li Shan held the medicine box, quietly watching as the headless fly-like figure searched in front of the hotel. Li Shan held up the medicine box and squatted in front of him.
1:7:55|1:8:14|Watching as [Li Shan] suddenly burst in, [Tom] casually and graciously set down his gun, then waved his hand as if in enjoyment. In an instant, the room was flooded with up to 20 well-dressed bodyguards. [Li Shan] leaped up from the ground, delivering a kick straight through the shoulder of one of the guards, followed by punches landing on the faces and necks of the others like a fish.
1:8:16|1:8:22|At this moment, a bodyguard firmly locked his arms from behind, while others quickly rushed towards him to grab his left hand holding the medicine box.
1:8:24|1:8:43|[Li Shan] performed a somersault to break free from the front, but was immediately lifted up by another bodyguard. Just as he was about to be dragged to the top of the long ladder and thrown out the door, [Li Shan] took a deep breath and punched the bodyguard in the chest, then opened the pill box and took the antidote. He then rushed towards Katie and the others in front of the door again.
1:8:43|1:8:59|Raising his hand heavily, [Li Shan] knocks out the bodyguard blocking his way. Then, he grabs the newcomer's collar, twists it hard, and quickly bends down, throwing the person over and slamming them to the ground. In the moment of being knocked down on both sides, he lifts his foot and fiercely kicks the shin of a bodyguard on the left side.
1:8:59|1:9:12|Suddenly, a bodyguard sprang out from the side and, catching Li Shan off guard, fiercely grabbed her neck with both arms, signaling the people in front to act quickly. Unexpectedly, Li Shan took advantage of the situation to kick and rise up, kicking directly at the faces of the two bodyguards in front of her.
1:9:14|1:9:21|Then, [Li Shan] raised his elbow and delivered a heavy blow to his back, causing the bodyguard with a severe blow to the temple to immediately let go and fall to the ground.
1:9:41|1:9:56|[Ling Xin] stood still for a moment, stunned. It wasn't until she heard [Li Shan]'s words that she subconsciously made a swallowing motion. Her eyes flickered as she glanced at him, then pursed her lips and rubbed her head. At this moment, another wave of bodyguards heard the commotion and quickly rushed over from outside the gate.
1:9:56|1:10:2|[Li Shan] naturally took [Ling Xin]'s hand and turned to walk towards the bodyguards.
1:10:7|1:10:22|[Li Shan] stood on the platform of the stairs, glanced at the bodyguards surging below, then reached out his left hand to [Ling Xin]. After they high-fived, the two stepped on the railing and jumped straight down from the platform. Seeing [Ling Xin] move swiftly and gracefully, the bodyguards charged straight towards her.
1:10:23|1:10:38|Unexpectedly, he first severely injured the bodyguard with a scorpion's white tail, then knocked him down heavily with a white leg in place, and then squatted down abruptly. Without waiting for the bodyguard to approach, he swept past with one leg, instantly resolving two opponents.
1:10:38|1:10:49|[Li Shan] is also no stranger to locking, monkeying, and leopard-like wrestling. He even picked up Katie, using himself as an axis for her to hang in his hand and kick back and forth.
1:10:54|1:11:11|Standing on the terrace, [Tom] watched the entire process, his fingers curling excitedly together. After listening to the instructions, [Swan] nodded gently and then left the room. In fact, Katie had already angrily descended to the underground parking lot, where she was intercepted by three bodyguards.
1:11:11|1:11:17|But she didn't slow down at all, with a raise of her palm, a swing of her elbow, a kick, she quickly took care of it.
1:11:22|1:11:42|Entering the off-road vehicle, after Katie and Tianke embraced tightly, the door slammed shut and they drove away from the hotel. In the room on the top floor of the hotel, the group of bodyguards saw only [Li Shan] left, and they walked up to surround him. Without realizing it, [Li Shan] was suddenly kicked in the chest by a bodyguard and fell on the long ladder.
1:11:42|1:11:50|With the capture imminent, a loud noise came from behind. [Li Shan] burst through the door and leaped high, but unfortunately fell to the ground upon landing.
1:11:59|1:12:20|A group of bodyguards hesitated to approach as they saw Right Brother aiming the gun back and forth. [Li Shan] took the opportunity to leave the room, causing Right Brother to panic. The next moment, he was grabbed by the bodyguards and the gun in his hand. In the chaos, he pulled the trigger, and a flame shot out from the muzzle. It turned out to be just a lighter.
1:12:49|1:13:6|[Tom] played with the remote control of the bomb, sitting in the back seat and looking at the jeep in front with a playful expression. At this moment, the necklace bomb tightly held by [Swan] seemed to sense the activation signal, and a dangerous sound came out. [Katie] glanced sideways, then angrily stepped on the gas pedal and fiercely turned the steering wheel.
1:13:42|1:13:57|Looking at the smiling pig head, [Tom] raised his hand to touch his lips, then fearlessly leaned on his chin. But as he watched the shadow of the jeep driving away, his eyes gradually became determined. Katie paid no attention to the rear, accelerated out of the city, and headed towards the forest path.
1:13:58|1:14:16|Katie suddenly drove up again. Tianke saw Katie approaching in the rearview mirror, then turned sharply and quickly caught up with her own jeep. Then, [Tom] slowly lowered the rear window, raised the remote control in his hand, and waved it towards Katie.
1:14:16|1:14:24|Katie took her eyes off the road and saw a small path blocked by a fence on the side of the road. Without hesitation, she turned the steering wheel sharply to the left.
1:14:26|1:14:38|The speeding car was spun around by the stationary jeep. When Mei Yi regained consciousness, Katie had already driven the off-road vehicle into the mud. Then, Katie drove onto another road.
1:14:42|1:15:2|As soon as the words fell, the alarm of the necklace bomb held tightly by Tianke sounded again. Katie's face changed, and she had to step on people again to accelerate forward. Tianke also unconsciously placed his hand on the necklace bomb, looking at Katie. Katie bent down and tightly held Tianke's left hand in her hand.
1:15:8|1:15:26|Upon hearing Li Shan's response, Katie looked straight ahead. At the end of the road, Li Shan was driving an SUV towards them at high speed. Full of confidence, Li Shan then handed out a small metal tube, about the size of a mineral water bottle with a flashing top, from the car.
1:15:27|1:15:48|As the two cars passed each other closely, Katie, who also had her hand out of the car, tightly held onto the small tube. After the handover, [Li Shan] breathed a sigh of relief and then, with a determined look, continued to drive straight ahead. Suddenly, [Tom] noticed that the signal pinpointing the exact location of the SUV disappeared from the screen.
1:15:48|1:15:54|[Li Shan] tightly gripped the steering wheel, yanked the handbrake down, and then made a sudden left turn, causing four wisps of smoke to billow up from behind the tires.
1:15:55|1:16:13|Tom didn't hesitate to give the order, and Li Shan had no choice but to step on the gas pedal, crashing into the car blocking the road. Li Shan showed no fear, just tightened his seatbelt with his hand, watching the other party coming straight at him, accompanied by the sound of metal scraping and steel frame tearing.
1:16:13|1:16:18|Li Shan's SUV was lifted into the air and tumbled repeatedly before crashing heavily onto the road surface of Liqing.
1:16:21|1:16:34|Li Shan and [Tom]'s heads slammed heavily against the deployed airbags. After a moment of daze, [Tom] first looked back at the completely wrecked ICUV, then turned to the front, searching for the traces of the off-road vehicle.
1:16:34|1:16:44|Seeing the off-road vehicle about to disappear at the end of the road, he raised the remote control high, pushed the door open, and hurriedly chased after it. It's unclear whether the remote control malfunctioned due to the crash.
1:16:45|1:17:2|Tom pressed the button several times, but there was no explosion. He started to panic. It wasn't until the sound of the explosion that a hot mushroom cloud bloomed in the sky, and he finally smiled. Then, Mei drove Tom away in a car with a wrecked front end.
1:17:2|1:17:13|Until the tail lights were no longer visible, two figures supporting each other hurriedly emerged from the trees on the side of the road. [Tom] changed into a brand new suit and approached the arcade machine.
1:18:21|1:18:33|The hotel chairman, who was tied to a chair, couldn't help but tremble, and then heard [Tom] whispering in his ear. Meanwhile, in the hotel suite on the other side, Miss [Ling Xin].
1:18:42|1:18:44|Just as [SWAN] and the others were regretting, [Tom] was already making plans.
1:19:4|1:19:20|The well-dressed bodyguards were seen carrying heavy aluminum alloy boxes out of the top floor of the hotel. Following each instruction, they first headed to the wind power station by the sea, then mobilized the convoy to arrive at a power control station with crisscrossing cables.
1:19:20|1:19:30|The destination may be different, but the boxes in the hands of each bodyguard are surprisingly consistent, while [Tom] sits on the top floor of the hotel, leisurely holding the controller and playing games.
1:19:43|1:19:48|Tian Ke quickly opened the laptop and searched the hotel's main server on the keyboard.
1:19:55|1:20:3|Just as [SWAN] was puzzled, [Ayo] sitting next to Tianke took out his phone to check, then turned back to look at Jingjian.
1:20:26|1:20:33|At this moment, with bruises on his face, [Li Shan] and Ayo walked out of the elevator. The five reunited friends exchanged smiles and then [SWAN] spoke.
1:20:52|1:21:6|Welcome just landed, [Baby] supported herself with one hand on the back of the sofa, then leaped up and jumped in front of [SWAN]. After a series of kicks and punches, she dropped her left fist to her waist, her right fist straight towards the floor-to-ceiling window, only to see the curtains in front of the window sensing and opening again.
1:21:6|1:21:14|The sunlight shone straight into the room, and the five people looked at the distant sea and sky meeting, then turned their gaze to the A Hotel diagonally in front of them.
1:21:18|1:21:33|[Li Shan] and Katie changed into couple outfits, pretending to be a couple checking in at the front desk of Hotel A, only to be invited to tonight's lantern festival by the front desk. Meanwhile, Yu Ge and [Baby] disguised themselves as luggage carriers, keeping a not-too-close distance from [Li Shan] and Katie.
1:21:33|1:21:42|Tianke stayed in the suite, manipulating the complex computer remotely in front of him. At this time, [Li Shan] and others had already dragged their suitcases to the elevator.
1:21:51|1:21:56|In the meantime, Li Shan, Katie, and Ayo have picked up their weapons and finished exchanging moves.
1:22:7|1:22:27|Tianke pressed the button, causing the lights on the top floor of Hotel A to short circuit and go out. [Tom]'s bodyguard shouted, and at that moment, the head bodyguard realized something was wrong and immediately ordered his men to retreat from the top floor stairs. Soon after, [Li Shan] and the other two walked out of the elevator.
1:22:32|1:22:50|Three figures stepped lightly into the room, then turned on their flashlights and walked to the long ladder in the center of the room based on their previous memory. Going down the ladder, they split up and searched for the target bomb. [Ayo] searched the bar counter, [Ling Xin] searched the flower bed, while [Katie] illuminated the central area of the house.
1:22:50|1:22:59|At this moment, [Ayo] swept the lights and suddenly noticed two suitcases on the pool table not far from the bar, with thumb-sized liquid bombs hidden inside.
1:23:6|1:23:29|Just as the three of them were using flashlights to explore around the pool table, the room suddenly lit up. In the suite, Mei Yi held a gun to the back of [SWAN]'s head. Taking advantage of Mei Yi's momentary distraction, she ordered into the intercom, and [SWAN] quickly hid the jamming device hanging around her neck into her collar.
1:23:33|1:23:50|Li Shan, Ayo, and Ling Xin hurried back to the pool table. Little did they expect that as soon as they took the box filled with bombs and walked down the steps, they saw the group of bodyguards returning. The bodyguards wasted no time and started shooting, forcing the three to bend down and quickly run into the bar to take cover.
1:23:50|1:23:55|[Li Shan] was about to rush out when [Katie] grabbed her arm and then glanced at [Ayo].
1:23:57|1:24:13|Katie glanced at [Li Shan] and then pushed him out. The bodyguard talked for a while, then started shooting wildly at him again. Unexpectedly, [Li Shan] didn't dodge at all. He pulled up the collar of his coat, wrapped it around his head, turned his back to the bodyguard, and stood tall like a ram.
1:24:23|1:24:40|Taking advantage of the distraction, Katie pulled out a stun gun and ambushed from the side, smoothly taking out two of the bodyguards. Then, [Li Shan] suddenly attacked from the flank, swinging a collapsible baton diagonally at the opponent, and finally delivered a shock, temporarily clearing out the guards inside the house.
1:24:40|1:24:59|Three of them hurried towards the elevator, passing by a bodyguard who was less than 1.5 meters tall. Without even looking at him, they rushed past, only to find him lifting two submachine guns and firing wildly in the direction they were leaving. Luckily, [Brother Right] quickly opened his bulletproof windbreaker, protecting [Li Shan] and Katie as they ran towards the elevator.
1:25:4|1:25:20|Li Shan and Katie took the box full of bombs from Ayo, and Baby turned to look down the corridor. At this moment, the short man's submachine gun had run out of bullets. Before Tom rushed into the elevator, two bodyguards ran from the side stairs and lunged forward, grabbing Tom's coat just in time.
1:25:21|1:25:36|Unlucky [Ayo] was pinned down right in front of the elevator door, with the other bodyguards pressing down on him. Seeing the elevator door not closing, [Li Shan] suddenly swung open his expandable baton. [Ayo] looked up at him, then obediently lowered his head.
1:25:36|1:25:41|Next, [Li Shan] opened the elevator control box, and the group of bodyguards were instantly subdued.
1:25:43|1:25:53|Watching as [Katie] and the others successfully ran onto the rooftop, [Baby] forcefully squeezed through the door frame, blocking the bodyguards who were trying to chase from behind. With a swift turn and punch, she managed to knock down all ten bodyguards.
1:25:54|1:26:6|Taking advantage of the bodyguard's momentary pause, Li Shan directly closed the door to the rooftop. Ayo tightly gripped the railing with both hands, and inadvertently seemed to hear a faint sound.
1:26:9|1:26:15|At this moment, [Li Shan] realized what was happening. Upon hearing this, [Ayo] glanced at the two boxes at his feet.
1:26:20|1:26:40|[Ayo], who had already swung his arm and leaned half of his body out of the building, quickly hit the brakes and barely pulled the two boxes back onto the rooftop. Below the rooftop, a large group of guests were holding wine glasses with a mix of worry and light. [Ayo] sighed with lingering fear, not knowing that the next second, the sound of an explosion would ring in his ears.
1:26:40|1:26:42|The lights in front of everyone suddenly went out.
1:26:43|1:27:4|In the distance, the brightly lit buildings by the seaside suddenly burst into flames, followed by a surge of hot fire from the connected structures. Then, the device that was originally generating electricity with maple leaves emitted a deafening roar, and shattered leaves fell like shooting stars, plunging the entire city into darkness in an instant.
1:27:12|1:27:17|Tom came to the suite, took off the Tianke's transmitter, stuck it behind his ear, stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling window, and enjoyed the fireworks blooming in the night.
1:27:36|1:27:56|Afterwards, Li Shan took out a remote control from his suit pocket, suddenly seeing himself as a conductor, gesturing towards A Hotel and then gently pressing the button. Behind him, Swan and the chairman of A Hotel, who were tied to the sofa, couldn't bear to witness it, quickly closing their eyes.
1:28:2|1:28:18|[Li Shan] tightly held onto Katie with one hand and removed the communicator with the other. Then, the other three quickly removed their shields. [Tom] held his head in his hands, his face contorted in pain. [Ayo] looked towards a box not far away.
1:28:38|1:28:42|[Baby] heard the instructions and angrily kicked the door of the hall, then three people rushed out.
1:28:51|1:29:6|The three of them wasted no time and headed straight to the location of [Tom] after snatching back the RV from the underground parking lot. The news of the RV escape quickly reached [Ayo]'s ears. She frowned, glanced at [Tom], and then quickly left the room. At this moment, they arrived at the [rooftop].
1:29:13|1:29:25|As soon as the words fell, [Li Shan] gestured for [Ayo] to look towards the door of the rooftop. A group of thugs with sticks and toolboxes rushed out from the door, [Ayo] looked satisfied at the crowd, then nodded.
1:29:25|1:29:36|On the other side, upon receiving the message, [Ayo] had already arrived at the entrance of the hotel. Upon seeing the RV of [Li Shan] and the others, she quickly raised her submachine gun and started shooting at them, causing the vehicle to crash by the roadside in the chaos.
1:29:37|1:29:54|[On the rooftop], after [Yan Shen] distributed the paper covers to everyone, he turned and squatted in front of [Ayo], watching him carefully suspend liquid bombs in the center of the paper covers. Meanwhile, [Mei Yi] quickly reloaded her gun and aimed the muzzle at the forced-stopped van again.
1:29:54|1:30:5|[Li Shan] quickly suggested that, coincidentally, [Ayo]'s gun jammed.
1:30:7|1:30:16|Then, [Katie] took the opportunity to jump off the RV with [Baby], using the cover of the cars scattered by the RV on the street, and ran straight towards the direction inside the hotel.
1:30:16|1:30:26|Downstairs, [Ayo] was bowing her head to change the magazine, but when she looked up, she felt a cold wind flash by, only to see [Li Shan] with a swift move, knocking the submachine gun out of her hand.
1:30:29|1:30:48|[Tom] finally found the problem, yanking the jammer from [Li Shan]'s neck and fiercely stomping on it with his shoe heel. Then he picked up the remote control and walked back to the floor-to-ceiling window.
1:30:48|1:30:56|While Tom closed his eyes and raised his hands to play in a trance, Katie loaded the bullet, firmly aiming at Tom's back.
1:30:57|1:31:0|[Katie] pulled the trigger, but [Tom] dodged swiftly.
1:31:21|1:31:39|At this moment, with no one blocking her path, [Katie] moved forward as another gunshot rang out. [Li Shan] stood frozen in place, while [Ayo] seized the opportunity to ride ahead. However, being not as tall with shorter legs than [Li Shan], [Ayo] was no match. As [Li Shan] leaped onto the street-side structure and turned around, a soaring kick landed directly on top of [Ayo]'s head.
1:31:39|1:32:0|On the rooftop of A Hotel, the thugs carefully lit the alcohol candles, placed under paper covers. Heat rose, causing the center of the paper covers to instantly expand. Then, one by one, small sky lanterns floated towards the pitch-black sky. The tourists looked up, gazing at the splendid beauty in the dark night, unable to contain their amazement.
1:32:0|1:32:12|Contrary to that, Li Shan came gasping into the suite and saw Katie, who had been shot in the leg, leaning against the edge of the sofa, heaved a sigh of relief. Then, he glanced sideways at Tom, who was aiming the gun at himself.
1:32:25|1:32:29|[Tom] swung his pistol, his face contorted in a grimace.
1:32:37|1:32:53|[Li Shan] shouted to stop, but the next moment, seeing the scene outside the window, he instantly halted his steps. The sky lantern rising into the dark night exploded in the high altitude dozens of meters away as [Tom] pressed the remote control button, resembling a fairy scattering flowers, illuminating the night as bright as day.
1:32:54|1:33:8|The happy smiles of the tourists below gradually became clear in the exploding flames. Unaware of the truth, they might think it's just a surprise and won't know they just narrowly escaped death.
1:33:8|1:33:16|At this moment, numerous sky lanterns are rising and exploding one after another, bursting open like crystals, rendering the night colorful and vibrant.
1:33:19|1:33:35|Katie, who took in everything with her eyes, looked at the gorgeous scenery outside the floor-to-ceiling windows. Xuanzhi's heart finally settled down. The original sound on the rooftop and the group of henchmen were even more excited, screaming and cheering for success, embracing each other as if they had survived a disaster.
1:33:35|1:33:55|At this moment, [Tom] realized something was wrong as he stood still and turned towards the window. Instead of seeing the destruction of the building and people fleeing as expected, he quickly turned back in anger and smashed the remote control. Tom raised his gun and aimed at [Li Shan], then lifted up the antidote box.
1:34:7|1:34:21|Tom stumbled backwards, knocking against the steps in front of the French window and falling backwards. The antidote in his hand slipped out of the window in an instant. [Li Shan] quickly got up and lunged forward, barely catching the medicine box, but the next moment, due to inertia, he fell out directly.
1:34:21|1:34:39|At the moment the first shot was fired, he tightly clung to the window sill with his right hand, while Tom got up and patted his suit before playfully walking towards the window. He then lifted one foot and ruthlessly kicked [Li Shan]'s hand. A shot hit near [Li Shan]'s hand, and after seeing him fall, he grabbed onto the railing outside the building.
1:34:39|1:34:57|This time, he aimed at the top of [Li Shan]'s head. Helpless, [Li Shan] looked at the struggling figure below her, gazing at the roaring sea. Tom was about to shoot and end it all. At that moment, [Ayo], despite the gunshot wound in her abdomen, suddenly flew from behind and grabbed Tom's arms.
1:34:57|1:35:10|Taking advantage of the two above being entangled, [Li Shan] used one hand to open the medicine box, put the antidote into his mouth. Then, gripping the wheel tightly with both hands, exerting force with his waist and abdomen, he grabbed the window sill, swung back into the room, and quickly approached the two.
1:35:11|1:35:31|A leg kicked out from the sky, hitting [Tom] on the neck and knocking him down, saving the baby from the barrel of [Tom]. [Li Shan] knelt on one knee, panting heavily, smiled slightly at the unconscious [Tom], then turned to look at Katie, but Katie's face suddenly changed.
1:35:34|1:35:49|When [Tom] aimed his gun at [Li Shan] again, [SWAN] and [Ayo] both acted with a box and a stun gun. However, before [SWAN] could make a move, [Tom] was shot by [Ayo], and under the strong electric shock, he finally passed out.
1:35:58|1:36:10|At this moment, [Li Shan] finally realized what was happening. He took a sip of the antidote in his mouth, stood up straight, and walked towards Katie with a smile on his face. He squatted down in front of Katie, gently held her face in his hands, and leaned in close.
1:36:15|1:36:40|[Li Shan] immediately lowered his arms. Behind him, [Ayo] had crawled over. [Li Shan] kept his lips tightly closed, then looked towards Katie. Seeing that [Li Shan] showed no intention of rescuing her, [Ayo] simply threw herself on top of her, then fiercely pressed her head towards her lips.
1:36:54|1:36:58|In the early morning, Li Shan, Ayo, and Ling Xin were curled up on the sofa in the suite, mumbling in their sleep.
1:37:9|1:37:14|Learning that those children who lost their families have all been sent to the orphanage.
1:37:19|1:37:34|[Li Shan] and Katie sat with their backs to the sunrise, looking out the floor-to-ceiling window and chatting with three others. Katie set down her water glass, blushing shyly as she lowered her head. After speaking, she turned to look at [Li Shan].
1:38:10|1:38:23|It turns out it was [Li Shan], and she recalled the scene that left a deep impression on her, even in her dreams she couldn't forget. At the same time, she held the pillow tightly to her chest, looking like she was about to burst into tears.
1:38:23|1:38:33|The two sitting in the center of the room paid no attention, and Katie instinctively hugged Li Shan's waist, while Li Shan tightly held her in his arms, closing his eyes to deepen the kiss.
1:38:34|1:38:43|Time passes, the vast Arctic snowfield stretches as far as the eye can see. The ice and snow seem to have fallen from the sky, standing in front of them. [Li Shan] and his group of five people are lying on the ice.
1:39:37|1:39:44|The film is about to say goodbye to you here, thank you for listening. Stay tuned for a post-credits scene at the end of the movie.
1:44:49|1:45:1|Now let's talk about the post-credits scene. With a sound of the shutter, [Tom], now in prison uniform, raises his name and ID tag, and steps in front of the camera to have his mugshot taken.
1:45:1|1:45:15|His expressionless face had lost its previous elegance, with stubble growing on his once smooth face, cheekbones slightly protruding, and a sinister look in his camera-facing eyes. But in the next second, a hint of a smile unexpectedly emerged from the corner of his eyes, and his lips gradually curved upwards.
1:45:18|1:45:20|At this moment, the lights suddenly dimmed.
